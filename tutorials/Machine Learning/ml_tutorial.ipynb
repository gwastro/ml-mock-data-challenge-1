    "In fact, the degree-10 polynomial is not a good fit. The plot above demonstrates that with a limited number of noisy data points, too high complexity model gives the best training loss (so it's a very good fit to that particular set of data), but has trouble generalizing to new data from the same underlying distribution. This phenomenon is called **overfitting**. It is the difference between fitting and predicting.\n",

    "One must therefore, when working with more complex data and models, be careful about model complexity - increasing it may lead to a better fit on training data and at the same time, to worse predictions on unseen data. Even if a model is perfectly suited to a given underlying true model, in the presence of limited and/or noisy data, a less complex model may reproduce the true model better. The only way to prevent this issue is to keep an eye on the out-of-sample loss. This is achieved by a dataset split.\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases, a dataset is supplied already split - in other cases, one must split the data themselves. In a lot of cases where the optimization is iterative, one must have a third separate dataset, called the **validation set**. Upon each iteration of the optimization algorithm over the training set, the loss on the validation set is evaluated to make sure that it is decreasing, and the training is typically interrupted once this is no longer the case. This in turn might also lead to slight overfitting on the validation dataset, which is why we still need the test set despite already having computed an out-of-sample validation loss."

The next `torch.nn.Linear` is the linear combination performed by the neurons: this outputs 10 numbers, each of which is a linear combination of the 784 inputs with independent coefficients as well as constant biases, all of which are trainable weights. Finally, the `torch.nn.Softmax` performs the Softmax operation as described a few blocks above.

    "A slightly more convoluted (sorry for the bad pun) type of neural networks has been inspired by the animal visual cortex. Convolutional layers are introduced, which slide *filters* over an input image, producing another image - often with a larger number of channels, so these can be hard to visualize. Each pixel in that output image is then basically the product of a smaller fully connected layer (like we used before) applied to a small portion of the input image. These layers are used to build **convolutional neural networks**, which typically consist of a convolutional part and a dense part. The convolutional part is constructed out of alternating convolutional layers and pooling layers (these downsample the image between the convolutional layers), the result is flattened and passed to a dense part, which is typically a deep neural network as shown before.\n",
    "\n",
    "This structure removes some less crucial connections between neurons and use many weights for multiple connections as opposed to a fully connected network. This allows us to build a network just as suited to some problems as a fully connected network while dramatically reducing the number of free parameters to be optimized. They have proven to be particularly suitable to computer vision problems.\n",

    "Congratulations! You have managed to get to the point where your network mostly misclassifies only those digits, which are badly written and are outliers in the dataset. We've only scratched the surface of what you can do with neural networks, but you've learned the most elementary things you need to know. Go ahead and play with this notebook - with the networks, with the training parameters, etc. Good luck!"
